# Motion-Detection

<p> This is still a work in progress <p>
<p> Once it's finished it weill used the computer vision module from Python's Anaconda to tell when an object moves <p>
<p> It does this by first taking a static shot of the background, and then if a certain number of pixels change, it registers it as a moving object <p>
<p> I decided to blur the images to reduce noise and to aide in setting the boxes <p>

<p> Note: In order for this to run you'll need an updated version of Python3 and the cv2 module (preferably from Anaconda). <p>
