# Motion-Detection

<p> This is still a work in progress <p>
<p> Once it's finished it weill used the computer vision module from Python's Anaconda to tell when an object moves <p>
<p> It does this by first taking a static shot of the background, and then if a certain number of pixels change, it registers it as a moving object <p>
